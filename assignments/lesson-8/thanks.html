thanks.html

Create a new page labeled thanks.html that expresses gratitude for filling out the form. This page should load when the user has successfully submitted the form. Hint: review the <form> attributes.
The submission of this form will not process any of the input, i.e, will not send email, create a database record, automatically publish to user comment page, etc. This processing is beyond the scope of the course but may be of great interest to you because the process is certainly relevant in the full-stack world of web development.
❏ The storm center and thank you pages need to meet all standard criteria of valid, standards-based, semantic markup and be responsive in all viewports.
❏ Copy the latest versions of your current pages and supportive files for the weather site into the lesson-9 folder, name them properly, and ensure that all three pages are linked properly in the navigation.
